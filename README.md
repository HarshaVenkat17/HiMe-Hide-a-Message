# HiMe-Hide-a-Message
A python Tkinter application to hide a message either by using Morse code or Steganography. 
It can be used to encode or decode a hidden message that is encoded using this application.
Steganography is the technique of hiding data within a file in order to avoid detection. The secret can then be extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for protecting the data.
