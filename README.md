# HiMe-Hide-a-Message
A python Tkinter application to hide a message either by using Morse code or Steganography. 
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within a file in order to avoid detection. The secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be combined with encryption as an extra step for protecting the data.
